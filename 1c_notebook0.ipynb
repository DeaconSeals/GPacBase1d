    "## Constraint satisfaction\n",
    "You may recall from the lectures that there are multiple ways to handle constraints in an EA. You can employ the following techniques:\n",
    "* ignore constraints\n",
    "* kill invalid offspring\n",
    "* feasible phenotype mapping decoder\n",
    "* repair function\n",
    "* feasible solution space closed under variation operators\n",
    "* penalty function\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, we're going to guide you through the process of making a  constraint satisfaction EA using a penalty function. This means that fitness will reflect not only the performance of the map but also how well the solution satisfies the constraint of a valid GPac map. Consequently, evolution will (hopefully) evolve maps that are increasingly difficult for pac-man *and* increasingly valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you might be asking the very sane question: *isn't there already a repair function?* \n",
    "\n",
    "Well... yes, GPac has constraints such that the mechanics of the game simply don't work if there's not a path between the spawn of pac-man and the ghosts or if pills/fruit can spawn in unreachable locations. You would typically use *either* a repair function or a penalty function, but in this assignment we're going to have you calculate a penalty based on the number of walls the repair function had to modify to create a valid GPac map. This is essentially evolving to minimize the impact (and any bias) of the repair function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following cell demonstrates how to determine the number of repairs made. Note that the behavior of `repair_and_test_map` is different from 1b because the config file contains an extra parameter assignment `return_repair_count = True`."
