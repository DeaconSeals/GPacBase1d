    "## Multi-Objective Fitness Evaluations\n",
    "In a traditional MOEA implementation like the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II [(NSGA-II)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/996017?casa_token=sIy9DHU74qAAAAAA:f9M0Nu6WrHIswdRILFlqhxUqW-rK1nfke65Xw88A1JNX5TaaXZAL76yrC3L8WncdUlrDi25Y7Zo), individuals in a population are assessed by multiple objectives, assigned a score for each objective, and are then sorted into levels of non-domination (more on that later) during parent and survival selection. In a traditional MOEA implementation, you might write a multi-objective version of k-tournament that samples k individuals from the population and selects the winner as the individual who is on the Pareto front from those k individuals. This formulation thus doesn't use a single-value notion of fitness as your existing k-tournament implementations do.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable the re-use of your existing selection algorithms, we propose a novel MOEA implementation that assigns individuals in a population a singular fitness value based on their level of non-domination. This behaves in a functionally equivalent manner in the rank-based selection algorithms used in traditional MOEA implementations. This also lets you use non-traditional selection algorithms like Fitness Proportional Selection in your MOEA, though they may perform poorly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your MOEA for this assignment, you will do the following:\n",
    "* Evaluate new members in a population to assign objective scores\n",
    "* Construct a domination table for *all* individuals in the population\n",
    "* Sort the population into levels of non-domination where level 0 is the Pareto front\n",
    "* To each individual in the population, assign a representative fitness that is inversely proportional to their level of non-domination \n",
    " - i.e., `num_levels - my_level`\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this, you'll implement three functions:\n",
    "1. `evaluate_popluation` - which assigns objective score to new population members after generation\n",
    "2. `dominates` - which takes individuals `A` and `B` as  inputs and returns `True` if `A` dominates `B`\n",
    "3. `non_domination_sort` - which sorts the population into levels of non-domination and assigns a representative fitness.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's start by showing an example of the multi-objective fitness function."
